# Introduction

This boilerplate is targeted towards large, serious projects and assumes you are somewhat familiar with Webpack and `kdu-loader`.

If you just want to try out `kdu-loader` or whip out a quick prototype, use the [kdujs-templates-webpack-simple](https://github.com/khanhduy1407/kdujs-templates-webpack-simple) template instead.

## Quickstart

To use this template, scaffold a project with [kdu-cli](https://github.com/khanhduy1407/kdu-cli). **It is recommended to use npm 3+ for a more efficient dependency tree.**

``` bash
$ npm install -g kdu-cli
$ kdu init kdujs-templates-webpack my-project
$ cd my-project
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
